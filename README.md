# Real-Time-Data-Analytics-SQL-Project-Beginner

Project Overview
This project is designed to help beginners understand SQL querying and performance analysis using real-time data from SQL Mentor datasets. In this project, you will analyze user performance by creating and querying a table of user submissions. The goal is to solve a series of SQL problems to extract meaningful insights from user data.

Objectives
Learn how to use SQL for data analysis tasks such as aggregation, filtering, and ranking.
Understand how to calculate and manipulate data in a real-world dataset.

Gain hands-on experience with SQL functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, EXTRACT(), and DENSE_RANK().
Develop skills for performance analysis using SQL by solving different types of data problems related to user performance.

Project Level: Beginner
This project is designed for beginners who are familiar with the basics of SQL and want to learn how to handle real-world data analysis problems. You'll be working with a small dataset and writing SQL queries to solve different tasks that are commonly encountered in data analytics.

SQL Mentor User Performance Dataset
The dataset consists of information about user submissions for an online learning platform. Each submission includes:

User ID
Question ID
Points Earned
Submission Timestamp
Username
This data allows you to analyze user performance in terms of correct and incorrect submissions, total points earned, and daily/weekly activity.

SQL Problems and Questions
Here are the SQL problems that you will solve as part of this project:

Q1. List All Distinct Users and Their Stats
Description: Return the user name, total submissions, and total points earned by each user.
Expected Output: A list of users with their submission count and total points.

Q2. Calculate the Daily Average Points for Each User
Description: For each day, calculate the average points earned by each user.
Expected Output: A report showing the average points per user for each day.

Q3. Find the Top 3 Users with the Most Correct Submissions for Each Day
Description: Identify the top 3 users with the most correct submissions for each day.
Expected Output: A list of users and their correct submissions, ranked daily.

Q4. Find the Top 5 Users with the Highest Number of Incorrect Submissions
Description: Identify the top 5 users with the highest number of incorrect submissions.
Expected Output: A list of users with the count of incorrect submissions.

Q5. Find the Top 10 Performers for Each Week
Description: Identify the top 10 users with the highest total points earned each week.
Expected Output: A report showing the top 10 users ranked by total points per week.
Key SQL Concepts Covered


Aggregation: Using COUNT, SUM, AVG to aggregate data.

Date Functions: Using EXTRACT() and TO_CHAR() for manipulating dates.

Conditional Aggregation: Using CASE WHEN to handle positive and negative submissions.

Ranking: Using DENSE_RANK() to rank users based on their performance.

Group By: Aggregating results by groups (e.g., by user, by day, by week).

    
SQL Queries Solutions
Below are the solutions for each question in this project:

Q1: List All Distinct Users and Their Stats
SELECT 
    username,
    COUNT(id) AS total_submissions,
    SUM(points) AS points_earned
FROM user_submissions
GROUP BY username
ORDER BY total_submissions DESC;


Q2: Calculate the Daily Average Points for Each User
SELECT 
    TO_CHAR(submitted_at, 'DD-MM') AS day,
    username,
    AVG(points) AS daily_avg_points
FROM user_submissions
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY username;


Q3: Find the Top 3 Users with the Most Correct Submissions for Each Day
WITH daily_submissions AS (
    SELECT 
        TO_CHAR(submitted_at, 'DD-MM') AS daily,
        username,
        SUM(CASE WHEN points > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS correct_submissions
    FROM user_submissions
    GROUP BY 1, 2
),
users_rank AS (
    SELECT 
        daily,
        username,
        correct_submissions,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY daily ORDER BY correct_submissions DESC) AS rank
    FROM daily_submissions
)
SELECT 
    daily,
    username,
    correct_submissions
FROM users_rank
WHERE rank <= 3;


Q4: Find the Top 5 Users with the Highest Number of Incorrect Submissions
SELECT 
    username,
    SUM(CASE WHEN points < 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS incorrect_submissions,
    SUM(CASE WHEN points > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS correct_submissions,
    SUM(CASE WHEN points < 0 THEN points ELSE 0 END) AS incorrect_submissions_points,
    SUM(CASE WHEN points > 0 THEN points ELSE 0 END) AS correct_submissions_points_earned,
    SUM(points) AS points_earned
FROM user_submissions
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY incorrect_submissions DESC;


Q5: Find the Top 10 Performers for Each Week
SELECT *  
FROM (
    SELECT 
        EXTRACT(WEEK FROM submitted_at) AS week_no,
        username,
        SUM(points) AS total_points_earned,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY EXTRACT(WEEK FROM submitted_at) ORDER BY SUM(points) DESC) AS rank
    FROM user_submissions
    GROUP BY 1, 2
    ORDER BY week_no, total_points_earned DESC
)
WHERE rank <= 10;


Conclusion
This project provides an excellent opportunity for beginners to apply their SQL knowledge to solve practical data problems. By working through these SQL queries, you'll gain hands-on experience with data aggregation, ranking, date manipulation, and conditional logic.
